My sister had been dropping hints all week, that I ignored until procrastination or maybe isolation hit me like a wave. It was time to bake some cookies. Now the question was: How far did I want to go? Did I want to attempt Tasty's 3 day cookie with browned butter and all? Or, did I want a classic? 

Knowing that neither I nor the fam were patient enough to wait 3 days, I went for the classic.
